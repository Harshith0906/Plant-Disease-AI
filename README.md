# Plant-Disease-AI
This project implements convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to perform image-based classification of plant leaf diseases. By accurately detecting and identifying diseased leaves, the system aims to support early intervention, minimize crop loss, and ultimately enhance agricultural productivity.
